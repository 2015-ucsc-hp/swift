This implementation needs to be updated to the new version of swift and
tested. Do not use it for any purposes other than development.

To use orientDB as the backend for swift's metadata server, replace
backend.py in ../ with th copy in this directory. A new version will 
most likely need to be made or copied from ../mariaDB for the new 
version of swift.
